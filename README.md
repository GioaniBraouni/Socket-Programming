# Socket-Programming
Inspired from the pandemic quarantine of 2021 , I created a simple client - server application using Java. 
The client sends his personal information(phone number , reason of transportation and home address) to 13033(Server).For every new sms packet(object) that has been received from the latter , it processes the sms packet and stores it local by creating a new file containing the information of the client.
